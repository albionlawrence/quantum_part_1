# Examples of nonrelativistic quantum particle dynamics

After spending some time with abstract discussions of dofferent Hilbert spaces, and simple two-state systems, we will now dig into an important class of quantum problems, that of a nonrelativistic particle moving in various potentials. This includes both scattering-type problems and bound state problems.
