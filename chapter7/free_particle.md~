# The free nonrelativistic particle

We begin by considering the "free" nonrelativistic particle -- that is, a particle with no force acting on it. The Hamiltonian is 
```{math}
:label: h_free
H = \frac{{\vec p}^2}{2m}
```
where $m$ is the particle mass. The time-dependent Schroedinger equation is
```{math}
:label: tdse_free
- \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \psi({\vec x}, t) = i \hbar \frac{\del}{\del t} \psi({\vec x}, t)
```
The solutions to the time-*independent* Schrodinger equation are clearly
```{math}
:label: 
\psi_E({\vec x}) = \frac{1}{(2\pi\hbar)^{1/2}}e^{i {\vec p}\cdot{\vec x}/\hbar}
