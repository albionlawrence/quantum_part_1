# The simple harmonic oscillator

The next potential we wish to consider is the *simple harmonic oscillator,
```{math}
:label: sho_ham
H = \frac{p^2}{2m} + \half m \omega^2 x^2
```
Tihs is exactly solvable in both classical and quantum mechanics. Why do we consider such a potential, besides this nice fact of classical solvablility? Because at low energies, it is often a good first approximation to a given potential.

Consider a more general 1d potential problem,
```{math}
H = \frac{p^2}{2m} + V(x)
```
We will consider energies so that the classically allowed region is near the absolute monimum of the potential. 

Now if we set $x = x_0$ as the location of this classical minimum, we can approximate $V(x)$ as:
```{math}
