# Physics 162a: Quantum Mechanics 1

These are the lecture notes for Physics 162a and Brandeis University. This is the first semester of a two-semester sequence whioch is required (at Brandeis) for first-year Physics graduate students, covering nonrelativistic quantum mechanics as well as some basic concepts in classical mechanics. 

The core book for this course is **Quantum Mechnics: An Experimentalist's Approach** by Eugene Commins. It is a very good book, but these notes will not be isomorphic to them. The student is encouraged to consulyt a variety of textbooks on a given subject, as well as their classmates and professor.

The first semester will focus more on basic concepts, illustrated by simple examples, mostly from one-dimensional 
non-relativistic particle machanics, although we will begin to discuss three dimensions at the end. The second semester will explore a wider variety of examples, especially from atomic and condensed-matter physics, and various methods for understanding complicated systems (symmetry methods and approximation schemes).
