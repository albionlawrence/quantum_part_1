# The Feynman Path Integral

Up to now we have developed a version of quantum mechanics based on the Hamiltonian. Classically, Hamilton's equations are first order equations in $2N$ phase space variables, and have unique solution when initial conditions for these variables are specified. Quantum mechanically, the time-dependent Schroedinger equation 
```{math}
i \del_t {\psi} = H \ket{\psi}
```
is a first-order equation whose solution is specified by an initial condition on the quantum state, and the Hamiltonian is the essential object that generated changes in time.

One might ask whether there is a quantum analog of the Lagrangian formulation. Indeed there is. We will focus on particle mechanics -- path integral formulations can be constructed for, eg, quantum spins, but this is a more complicated (though extremely interesting) story.

Recall that classicalt, the Lagrangian story begins by specifying the classical action 
```{math}
S[x^I(t)] = \int_{t_0}^{t_1} dt L(x^I(t), {\dot x}^I(t), t)
```
we assume $I \in \{1,\ldots,N\}$. Classically one considers all paths with
