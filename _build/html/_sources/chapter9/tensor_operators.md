# Tensor operators

So far we have mostly discussed the action of transformations on quantum states. But transformations are also defined by their action on operators:
```{math}
A \to U A U^{\dagger} = A'
```
In the case that the transformation is infintesimal, $U = {\bf 1} - i \eps K + \cO(\eps^2)$ with $K$ Hermitian, then to $\cO(\eps)$, we have
```{math}
A' = A - i \eps [K,A]
```
We cna compare this to the change in classical observables under a transformation generated by an obserbale $K(p,q)$: for this %\delta A = - \{K, A\}$ where $\{ , \}$ is the Poisson bracket.

Now operators also form a vector space under addition. So we can expect them to form irreps of the 
transformation group. Here we will discuss such operators in the case of the rotation group.

## Example: position operators

To get our heads around the concept of the transformation of operators. To see how these transform, consider the matrix element
```{math}
\begin{align}
\bra{\chi} ({\hat x}^i)' \ket{\psi} & = \bra{\chi} U(R) {\hat x}^i U^{\dagger}(R) \ket{\psi}\\
& = \int d^3 x \chi^*(R^{-1} x) x^i \psi(R^{-1} x)
\end{align}
```
Now, we can change variables as ${\vec x} \to {\vec (Rx)}$. Because $R$ has determinant $1$, the measure factor does not change and we have```{math}
```{math}
\bra{\chi} ({\hat x}^i)' \ket{\psi} = \int d^3 x \chi^*(x) R^i_j x^j \psi(x)
```
This is true for any pair of states, so we have $({\hat x}^i)' = R^i_j {\hat x}^j$; the operator transforms the same way as a vector in physical space.

In the case of infinitesimal transformations, we can expand out $R$. Instead, let us consider the simple case of an infinitesimal rotation about the $z$ axis. In this case, $U \sim {\bf 1} - \frac{i\phi}{\hbar} J_z$, and so $({\hat x}^i)' = {\hat x}^i - \frac{i\phi}{\hbar} [J_z, {\hat x}^i]$. Thus
```{math}
\begin{align}
{\hat x}' & = {\hat x} + \phi {\hat y}\\
{\hat y}' & = {\hat y} - \phi {\hat y}\\
{\hat z}' & = {\hat z}
\end{align}
```
This is precisely how a vector transforms under infinitesimal rotations about the $z$ axis.
The first two transformations can be reassembled like so:
```{math}
({\hat x} \pm i {\hat y})' = ({\hat x} \pm i {\hat y})(1 \pm i \phi)
```
Under finite rotations, $A' = e^{-i \phi J_z/\hbar} A e^{i\phi J_z/\hbar}$. To see how this changes with $\phi$, we compute
```{math}
\frac{\del}{\del \phi} A' = \frac{\del}{\del \phi} \left(e^{-i \phi J_z/\hbar} A e^{i\phi J_z/\hbar}\right) = \frac{- i}{\hbar} \left(e^{-i \phi J_z/\hbar} [J_z,A] e^{i\phi J_z/\hbar}\right)
```
Now in the present case we have
```{math}
\begin{align}
\frac{\del}{\del\phi} (x + i y)' & = y' - i x' = i (x + i y)'\\
\frac{\del}{\del\phi} (x - i y)' & = - i (x - i y)'\\
\frac{\del}{\del\phi} z' = 0
\end{align}
```
Integraing these equations from $\phi = 0$, we find
```{math}
\begin{align}
(x + i y)' & = (x + i y) e^{i\phi}\\
(x - i y)' & = (x + i y) e^{-i\phi}\\
z' & = z
\end{align}
```
In other words, under rotations, $x \pm i y$ transform as the $m = \pm 1$ components of a spin-1 irrep, and $z$ as the $m = 0$ component. We can show that the commutators of $J_{\pm}$ with $x \pm i y$ and $z$ raise and lower $m$ as expected.

## Spherical tensor operators

More generally, we denote the *irreducible spherical tensor operators* $\cO^j_m$ for fixed $j$ as operators which transform as a spin-$j$ irrep under commutators with ${\vec J}$. In particular, this means
```{math}
\begin{align}
[J_z, \cO^j_m] & = \hbar m \cO^j_m\\
[J_{\pm}, \cO^j_m] & = \hbar \sqrt{j(j+1) - m(m\pm 1)} \cO^j_{m\pm 1}
\end{align}
```
Under finite rotations, we have
```{math}
U(R) \cO^j_m U(R)^{\dagger} = d^j_{m,m'} \cO^j_{m'}
```
so the operators transform just as the $\ket{j,m}$ states do.

The simples tensor operators have specific names:
1. An operator $\cO^0_0$ is called a *scalar operator*; it does not change under rotations. Thee include operators such as ${\hat {\vec p}}^2$, ${\vec J}^2$, and so on.
2. The operators $\cO^{1/2}_{\pm \half}$ are called *spinor operators*. Off the tiop of my head the examples I can think of appear in quantum field theory.
3. The operators $\cO^1_{\pm 1}$, $\cO^1_0$ are called *vector operators*. We can find linear combinations which transform the same way as a vector in $\CR^3$. Examples as ${\hat {\vec x}}$,  ${\hat {\vec p}}$,  
${\hat {\vec J}}$.

## Relationship to cartesian tensors

In general when people say "tensors" they have in mind objects with lots of indices that run form $1,\ldots d$ (where $d$ is the dimension fo spacetime). One example is the totally antisymmetric tensor $\eps_{ijk}$. 

In general, a tensor in $\CR^3$ is an object of the form
```{math}
T^{i_1,\ldots,i_m}{}_{j_1,\ldots,j_n}\ ,
```
where $i_k, j_k \in \{1,\ldots,d\}$, that transforms as follows under rotations $R$:
```{math}
T^{i_1,\ldots,i_m}{}_{j_1,\ldots,j_n} \to R^{i_1}_{i'_1}\ldots E^{i_m}_{i'_m} (R^{-1})^{j'_1}_{j_1}\ldots  (R^{-1})^{j'_m}_{j_m}T^{i'_1,\ldots,i'_m}{}_{j'_1,\ldots,j'_n}
```
The upper indices are called *contravariant* indices and the lower indices *covariant* indices. The reason for this nomenclature is based on how the transform relative to the gradient operator $\frac{\del}{\del x^i}$; the chain rule shows that
```{math}
\frac{\del}{\del x^i} \to (R^{-1})^k_i \frac{\del}{\del x^k}
```
Thus the upper indices transform oppositely to this (thus *contra*variant), and the lower indices transform in the same way (thus *co*variant).

Note that the coordinates $x^i$ are thus contravariant vectors. As it happens, the momenta $p_i$ are covariant vectors. This is compatible with their representation in quantum mechanics ${\hat p}_i = \frac{\hbar}{i} \frac{\del}{\del x^i}$. 

Such tensors form reducible representations of the rotation group. We can see they behave like tensor products of the spin-$1$ irrep. From these, we can try to work out combinations that transform as irreps. The general theory is complicated; we will work out a simple example.

Consider a 2-index contravariant tensor $T^{ij}$. This has 9 total components. Since under the rules for tensor products of irreps of the rotation group, $D_1\otimes D_1 = D_2 \oplus D_1 \oplus D_0$, we expect $T^{ij}$ to be written in terms of a scalatr operator, a vector operator, and a $j = 2$ tensor operator. To see this note that the *total* angular omentum in $D_1\otimes D_2$ is invariant under exchange of these two factors. For the tensor, this corresponds to the exchange of the two indices. Therefore, we expect a given irrep to correspond to tensors which come back to themselves up to $\pm 1$ under the exchange of indices.

First, we can form $T = \frac{1]{3} \delta_{ij} T^{ij}$. Orthogonality of the rotation matrices guarantees that this is invariant under rotations; so this is a scalar operator.

Next, we can consider $T_{as}^{ij} = \half \left(T^{ij} - T^{ji}\right)$. This has three components. The following object 
```{math}
T_i = \frac{1}{2} \epsilon_{ijk} T^{jk}
```
depends on the same three components; it transforms as a (covariant) vector. So the antisymmetric part of $T$ is a vector opwerator.

Finally, this leaves $T_s^{ij} = \half(T^{ij} + T^{ji}) - \delta_{ij} T$. This is traceless and symmetric. By removing the trace, the resulting symmetric tensor has 5 independent parameters. Thus the components transform as operators of the form $\cO^2_m$, $m \in \{-2,1,0,1,2\}$. 

## Action on states and the Wigner-Eckart theorem

Let us consider a spherical temsor operator $\cO^{j_1}_{m_1}$ acting on a state $\ket{\alpha, j_2 m_2}$. where $\alpha$ denote sadditional quantum numbers. Under finite rotations, this transforms as
```{math}
\begin{align}
\cO^{j_1}_{m_1}\ket{\alpha, j_2 m_2} & \to U(R) \cO^{j_1}_{m_1}\ket{\alpha, j_2 m_2}\\
& = U(R) \cO^{j_1}_{m_1}U(R)^{\dagger} U(R) \ket{\alpha, j_2 m_2}\\
& = d^{j_1}_{m_1,m_1'}  \cO^{j_1}_{m_1'} d^{j_2}_{m_2,m_2'}\ket{\alpha, j_2 m_2'}
\end{align}
```
But this behaves exactly like s state in the tensor product $D_{j_1}\otimes D_{j_2}$. Furthermore, if we act on this state with the operator $J_z$, using $[J_z,\cO^j_m] = \hbar m \cO^j_m$, we have
```{math}
J_z \cO^{j_1}_{m_1}\ket{\alpha, j_2 m_2} = \hbar(m_1 + m_2)  \cO^{j_1}_{m_1}\ket{\alpha, j_2 m_2}
```
Thus,
```{math}
\cO^{j_1}_{m_1}\ket{j_2 m_2,\alpha} = \oplus_{j = |j_1 - j_2|}^{j = j_1 + j_2} c_j^{\beta} \ket{\beta, j, m_1 + m_2}
```

This leads to the following important theorem, the *Wigner-Eckart theorem*. It comes from taking matrix elements of the commutators of $J_z, J_{\pm}$ with $\cO$. We will not prove it here, but simply state it:
```{math}
\bra{\alpha_1, j_1, m_1} \cO^{j_2}_{m_2} \ket{\alpha_3, j_3, m_3} = \langle \alpha_1, j_1 || \cO^{j_2} || \alpha)3, j_3 \rangle \brket{j_1,m_2; j_2,m_2}{j_3,m_3}
```
Here $\brket{j_1,m_2; j_2,m_2}{j_3,m_3}$ is a Clebsch-Gordon coefficient for the expansion of $D_{j_1}\otimes D_{j_2}$ into irreps with angular momentum $j_3$; while $ \langle \alpha_1, j_1 || \cO^{j_2} || \alpha_3, j_3 \rangle$ is a *reduced matrix element*. The essential point is that it is independent of $m_k$; all of the $m_k$ dependence, and the information about which $j_3$ appear at all, are contained in the Clebsch-Gordon coefficients. This is *kinematic* information, goverened entirely by the properties under rotation. The *dynamical* informatio, dependent on the detailed nature of the system, is contained in the reduced matrix element. To calculate this, we need merely compute the matrix element for specific set of $m_k$s. We can then divide by the Clebsch-Gordon coefficient for that set, to extract the reduced matrix element; all other matrix elements as above are then determined by the reduced matrix element and the Clebsch-Gordon coefficients which are known (and can be looked up).
