# The Variational Method

The next two techniques we wish to discuss are cases in which the Hamiltonian is not obviously close to solvable; thus, we consider them "nonperturbative". These are the variational method and the WKBJ approximation. Essentially, the former works for ground state energies and the latter for highly excited states.
