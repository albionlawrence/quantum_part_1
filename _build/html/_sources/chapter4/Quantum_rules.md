# The Rules of Quantum Mechanics

Now that we have set up the needed math, the basic ruls of quantum mechanics are fairly easy to state, though their implications are famously confusing. Our strategy here will be to illustrate and explore them with some mathematically simple systems (photons and massive spin-$\half$ particles). We can then move on to particle mechanics (after setting up a bit of additional math).
