# Newton's Laws

## The second law 

The classic presentation of Newton's second law of motion is the famous

```{math}
:label: newton_second
\begin{align}
{\vec F}_{k = 1,ldots N}(t) & = m_k {\vec a}_k \\
& \equiv m_k \ddot{\vec x}_k(t) \\
& \equiv m_k \frac{d^2}{dt^2} {\vec x}_k(t)
\end{align}
```



where we have written this for $N$ particles with masses $m_k$ and positions ${\vec x}_k(t)$ in 3 dimensions. This is a *second order differential equation in time*. The upshot of this is that if we know the positions and velocities of the particles at some initial time $t_i$, we know the trajectories at all time. To start with, at time $t_i + \Delta t$,

```{math}
:label: newton_evolve
\begin{align}
{\vec x}_k(t_i + \Delta t) & = {\vecx}_k(t_i) + \Delta t \dot{\vec x}_k(t_1)\\
\dot{\vec x}_k(t_i + \Delta t) & = \dot{\vec x}_k(t_i) + \Delta t \ddot{\vec x}_k(t_i) \\
& = \dot{\vec x}_k(t_i) + \Delta t {\vec F}_k(t_i)
\end{align}
```
