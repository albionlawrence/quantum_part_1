# Constrained Lagrangian Systems

I advertised that one advantage of Lagrangian dynamics is the ability to easily incorporate constraints. I should have said, *some* constraints; there are some that Lagrangian mechanics cannot handle (just as the framework does poorly with friction). Still when it works, it is very powerful.

So we will open by describing different types of constraints, and then move to redoing the mead-on-a-wire example we covered in the first week of the course.

## Holonomic and non-holonomic constraints

### Holonomic constraints

These are constraints that can be simply written as a set of algebraic equations on the space of coordinates, that us, 

```{math}
:label: constraint_equations
f_{\alpha}(q^I) = 0
```

where $I = 1, \ldots D$ and $\alpha = 1,\ldots, m < D$. This is $m$ equations in $D$ unknowns. The solutions form an $n = D - m$-dimensional space of solutions (under the right conditions, called a *submanifold*); while $m$ is called the *codimension* of this space. Roughly the codimension is the number of directions that is in some sense perpendicular to this space.

1. As a simple example, for a single particle in $d = 3$, $f_1 = z = 0$ defines the $x-y$ plane. Similarly, $y = 0$ defines the $x-z$ plane. In each case the dimension of the space of solutions is $2$ and the codimension $1$.

2. In this language the $x$ axis satisfies $f_1 = z = 0$, $f_2 = y = 0$. The $x$ axis is the intersection of the $xy$ and $xz$ planes. The dimension of the space of solutions is $1$ and the codimension $2$.

3. A more complicated example is $x^2 + y^2 - R^2 = 0$ in $D = 2$, which describes a circle with radius $R$.

4. The constraint equation $f_1 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - R^2 = 0$ defines a sphere of radius $R$ in $3$ dimensions. If we also include $f_2 = z- \ell$ with $\ell < < R$, then we have a circle parallel to the $x-y$ plane, with  radius $\sqrt{R^2 - \ell^2}$

We can parameterize the space of solutions with a set of coordinates $s^i$, so that $q^I(s^i)$ lies on the space of solutions. This paramaterization may have to be *local*; for example, in the case of a sphere, we often use different parameters to describe the northern and southern hemisphere.

These will turn out to be simply dealth with in Lagrangian mechanics via Lagrange multiplier techniques.

### Non-holonomic constraints.

This is basically every other type of constraint and there are several ways a constraint can fail to be holonomic.

1. Non-integrable constraint. Let is impose constraints locally on each point of the ambient space. That is, locally at each point $q^I_0$, we demand that motion away from this point by an infinitestimal $\delta q^I$ must satisfy

```{math}
:label: local_constraint
F_{I,\alpha}(q^I_0) \delta q^I = 0
```

Locally, in some infinitesimal neighborhood, this will look like a holonomic constraint. But there is no guarantee that this will hold globally. This failure will hold if $F_I$ is not integrable, that is if we cannot write it as

```{math}
:label: integrability
F_{I,\alpha}(q^I_0) = \frac{\del f_{\alpha}}{\del q^I} \Big|_{q^I = q^I_0}
```

wuth $f_{\alpha}(q^I_0) = 0$ (which we can achieve by a constant shift of $f$). If we *can* satisfy {eq}`integrability`, then {eq}`local_constraint` becomes 

```{math}
:label: infinitesimal_holonomic
\begin{align}
f_{\alpha}(q^I_0) + \delta q^I) & = f_{\alpha}(q^I_0) + \frac{\del f_{\alpha}}{\del q^I}(q^I_0) \delta q^I + {\cal O}(\delta q^2) \\
& \equiv f_{\alpha}(q^I_0) F_{I,\alpha} \delta q^I + {\cal O}(\delta q^2)
\end{align}
```

Otherwise
