# The Rotation Group in Quantum Mechanics

Following convention, we will spend some time on the behavior of quantum systems under rotations. There are two reasons for this. First, rotational symmetry plays an important role in many practical applications, such as atoms and spin systems. Secodly, the structure of the rotation group, and of Hilbert spaces on which rotations act nontrivially, are models for other important transformations in quantum systems.
