# Physics 162a: Quantum Mechanics 1

These are the lecture notes for Physics 162a at Brandeis University. PHYS 162a is the first semester of a two-semester sequence that is required for first-year Physics graduate students. PHYS 162a and PHYS 162b cover nonrelativistic quantum mechanics as well as some basic concepts in classical mechanics.

The required book for this course is *Quantum Mechanics: An Experimentalist's Approach* by Eugene Commins {cite:p}`commins2014quantum`, essentially the textbook version of the author's very popular course at UC Berkeley. These notes represent my own take on the subject matter, based on some 33-odd years (counting my own PhD studies) as a theoretical physicist. The student is encouraged to consult a variety of textbooks on a given subject, as well as their classmates and professor.

The first semester will focus more on basic concepts, illustrated by simple examples, mostly from one-dimensional 
non-relativistic particle mechanics, although we will begin to discuss three dimensions at the end. The second semester will explore a wider variety of examples, especially from atomic and condensed-matter physics, and various methods for understanding complicated systems (especially symmetry methods and approximation schemes).

A note for any outside readers: if you find this useful, that's awesome. Note that these lectures are the result of a dynamic interaction with the particular students I teach, and will skip over in-class activities aimed at cementing their knowledge. Finally these are not going to be completely clean, especially for now; they are the typed equivalent of written lecture notes, done so that I can more easily update in future classes.
