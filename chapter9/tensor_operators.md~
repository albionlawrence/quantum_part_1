# Tensor operators

So far we have mostly discussed the action of transformations on quantum states. But transformations are also defined by their action on operators:
```{math}
A \to U A U^{\dagger} = A'
```
In the case that the transformation is infintesimal, $U = {\bf 1} - i \eps K + \cO(\eps^2)$ with $K$ Hermitian, then to $\CO(\eps)$, we have
```{math}
A' = A - i \eps [K,A]
```
We cna compare this to the change in classical observables under a transformation generated by an obserbale $K(p,q)$: for this %\delta A = - \{K, A\}$ where $\{ , \}$ is the Poisson bracket.

Now operators also form a vector space under addition. So we can expect them to form irreps of the 
transformation group. Here we will discuss such operators in the case of the rotation group.

## Example: position operators

To get our heads around the concept of the transformation of operators. To see how these transform, consider the matrix element
```{math}
\begin{align}
\bra{\chi} ({\hat x}^i)' \ket{\psi} & = \bra{\chi} U(R) {\hat x}^i U^{\dagger}(R) \ket{\psi}\\
& = \int d^3 x \chi^*(R^{-1} x) x^i \psi(R^{-1} x)
\end{align}
```
Now, we can change variables as ${\vec x} \to {\vec (Rx)}$. Because $R$ has determinant $1$, the measure factor does not change and we have```{math}
```{math}
\bra{\chi} ({\hat x}^i)' \ket{\psi} = \int d^3 x \chi^*(x) R^i_j x^j \psi(x)
```
This is true for any pair of states, so we have $({\hat x}^i)' = R^i_j {\hat x}^j$; the operator transforms the same way as a vector in physical space.

In the case of infinitesimal transformations, we can expand out $R$. Instead, let us consider the simple case of an infinitesimal rotation about the $z$ axis. In this case, $U \sim {\bf 1} - \frac{i\phi}{\hbar} J_z$, and so $({\hat x}^i)' = {\hat x}^i - \frac{i\phi}{\hbar} [J_z, {\hat x}^i]$. Thus
```{math}
\begin{align}
{\hat x}' & = {\hat x} + \phi {\hat y}\\
{\hat y}' & = {\hat y} - \phi {\hat y}\\
{\hat z}' & = {\hat z}
\end{align}
```
This is precisely how a vector transforms under infinitesimal rotations about the $z$ axis.
The first two transformations can be reassembled like so:
```{math}
({\hat x} \pm i {\hat y})' = ({\hat x} \pm i {\hat y})(1 \pm i \phi)
```
Under finite rotations, $A' = e^{-i \phi J_z/\hbar} A e^{i\phi J_z/\hbar}$. To see how this changes with $\phi$, we compute
```{math}
\frac{\del}{\del \phi} A' = \frac{\del}{\del \phi} \left(e^{-i \phi J_z/\hbar} A e^{i\phi J_z/\hbar}\right) = \frac{- i}{\hbar} \left(e^{-i \phi J_z/\hbar} [J_z,A] e^{i\phi J_z/\hbar}\right)
```
Now in the present case we have
```{math}
\begin{align}
\frac{\del}{\del\phi} (x + i y)' & = y' - i x' = i (x + i y)'\\
\frac{\del}{\del\phi} (x - i y)' & = - i (x - i y)'\\
\frac{\del}{\del\phi} z' = 0
\end{align}
```
Integraing these equations from $\phi = 0$, we find
```{math}
\begin{align}
(x + i y)' & = (x + i y) e^{i\phi}\\
(x - i y)' & = (x + i y) e^{-i\phi}\\
z' & = z
\end{align}
```
In other words, under rotations, $x \pm i y$ transform as the $m = \pm 1$ components of a spin-1 irrep, and $z$ as the $m = 0$ component. We can show that the commutators of $J_{\pm}$ with $x \pm i y$ and $z$ raise and lower $m$ as expected.

## Spherical tensor operators

More generally, we denote the *irreducible spherical tensor operators* $\cO^j_m$ for fixed $j$ as operators which transform as a spin-$j$ irrep under commutators with ${\vec J}$. In particular, this means
```{math}
\begin{align}
[J_z, \cO^j_m] & = \hbar m \cO^j_m\\
[J_{\pm}, \cO^j_m] & = \hbar \sqrt{j(j+1) - m(m\pm 1)} \cO^j_{m\pm 1}
\end{align}
```
Under finite rotations, we have
```{math}
U(R) \cO^j_m U(R)^{\dagger} = d^j_{m,m'} \cO^j_{m'}
```
so the operators transform just as the $\ket{j,m}$ states do.

The simples tensor operators have specific names:
1. An operator $\cO^0_0$ is called a *scalar operator*; it does not change under rotations. Thee include operators such as ${\hat {\vec p}}^2$, ${\vec J}^2$, and so on.
2. The operators $\cO^{1/2}_{\pm \half}$ are called *spinor operators*. Off the tiop of my head the examples I can thinf of appear in QFT.
3. The operators $\cO^1_{\pm 1}$, $\cO^1_0$ are called *vector operators*. We can find linear combinations which transform the same way as a vector in $\CR^3$. Examples as ${\hat {\vec x}}$,  ${\hat {\vec p}}$,  
${\hat {\vec J}}$
