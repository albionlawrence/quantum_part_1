# Representations of the rotation group

## General structure

We will find that the commutation relations of *infinitesimal* operators put strong constraints o n the irreducible representations of the rotation group. The basic strategy is somewhat analogous to that we used to solve for the simple harmonic oscillator. 

Recall that for infinitesimal rotations by angle $\theta$ about an axis described by unit vector ${\hat n}$, $R \sim \delta - i \theta \frac{{\vec J}\cdot{\hat n}}{\hbar}$; the commutation relations of $J$ are: $[J_I, J_J] = i\hbar \epsilon_{IJK} J^K$. 

In a unitary representation, $U(R) \sim {\bf 1} - i \theta \frac{{\hat J}^I {\hat n}_I}{\hbar}$ where ${\hat J}$ is a Hermitian operator. As we have shown, the commutation relations of innfinitesimal operators determine the structure of non-Abelian multiplication for any group elements (which can be built from successive infinitesimal rotations). Therefore ${\hat J}^I$ must satisfy the same algebra as the matrices we constructed above: [{\hat J}_I, {\hat J}_J] = i \hbar \epsilon_{IJK} {\hat J}^K$.
