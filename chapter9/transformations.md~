# Transformations and symmetries

![Transformations of a quantum system](transformations.png)

Above we see how tranlations and rotations act on a measurement process. Note that we apply them to the system itself (the red formless blob), the experimental apparatus (the box with the dial), the observer, and the environment (such as the gravitational field). We can think of these as *active* transformations, physically rotating everythingl or as *passive* transformations, corresponding to changes of coordinates.

Either way, the principle is that with such transformations, the results of experiments should be the same. 

## Transformations

### Definition

To begin with, we give a precise definition of transformations acting on quantum systems. These are linear maps
```{math}
\begin{align}
& {\cal T}: \ket{\psi} \to \ket{\psi'}\\
& {\cal T}: {\cal O} \to {\cal O}'
\end{align}
```
for all states $\ket{\psi'}$ and operators ${\cal O}'$, such that observed quantities do not change. These are matrix elements:
```{math}
\begin{align}
|\brket{\psi'}{\chi'}|^2 & = |\brket{\psi}{\chi}|^2\\
\bra{\psi'}{\cal O}'\ket{\psi'} & = \bra{\psi}{\cal O}\ket{\psi}
\end{align}
```
(you might think you want to know all matrix elements of ${\cal O}$, but in practice measurements can be phrased as expectation values of projecttion operators as we have discussed -- also, it happens that if you know the expectation value of ${\cal O}$ for all states, you know all matrix elements. We'll prove that at the end of this section so as not to interrupt the flow). 

One can easily prove the following (see {cite:p}`bellac2006quantum` or 
{ref}`messiah1999quantum`):

*Theorem*: give a transformation ${\cal T}$, we can modify the transformed states $\ket{\psi'} \to e^{i\alpha(\ket{\psi'})}\ket{\psi'}$ such that the transformation is implemented by a linear operator $U_{{\cal T}}$:
```{math}
\begin{align}
\ket{\psi'} & = U_{{\cal T}} \ket{\psi}\ \forall \ket{\psi}\\
{\cal O}' & = U_{{\cal T}} {\cal O} U_{{\cal T}}^{\dagger}
\end{align}
```
such that $U^{\dagger}_{{\cal T}} = U^{-1}_{{\cal T}}$ and $U_{{\cal T}}$ is either:

1. A **linear** operator (and thus unitary), or
2. An **antilinear** operator, that is one satsifying
```{math}
U_{{\cal T}}\left(a \ket{\psi} + b \ket{\chi}\right) = a^* U_{{\cal T}} \ket{\psi} + b^* U_{{\cal T}} \ket{\chi}
```

Antilinear operators of this kind are important in particle physics and quantum condensed matter physics -- in particular the transformation of *time reversal* is implemented by such an operator.

### Examples

It is worth mentioning a few examples:

1. *Translations*. These are induced by the spatial transformation ${\vec x} \to {\vec x} + {\vec a}$. The action on wavefunctions would be $\psi({\vec x}) \to \psi({\vec x} - {\vec a})$. As we've shown before, $U_{{\vec a}} = e^{- i {\hat{\vec p}}\cdot a/\hbar}$; 
```{math}
	\bra{{\vec x}}U_{{\vec a}}\ket{\psi} = \psi({\vec x} - {\vec a}\ ,
```
and
```{math}
	U_{{\vec a}} {\hat{\vec x}} U_{{\hat a}}^{\dagger} = {\hat{\vec x}} + {\vec a}
```

2. *Rotations*. These will be explained in great detail below.

3. *Parity*. This is related to the spacetime transformation ${\vec x} \tp - {\vec x}$. In quantum mechanics it is implemented by a unitary operator $\Pi = \Pi^{\dagger} = \Pi^{-1}$. For states in $L^2(\CR^3)$ we have
```{math}
\begin{align}
\bra{{\vec x}} \Pi \ket{\psi} & = \psi(-x) \\
\Pi {\hat{\vec x}} \Pi & = - {\hat{\vec x}}\\
\Pi {\hat{\vec p}} \Pi & = - {\hat{\vec p}}
\end{align}
```
4. *Isospin*. Nucleons have a spin degree of freedom and also an "isospin" degree of freedom; these contribute a factor $\cH = \CC^2 \otimes \CC^2$ to the hilbert space. Just as a good basis for the Hilbert space of a spin-$\half$ particle is the spin-up and spin-down states along some axis, a good basis for the isospin degree of freedom is the proton state and the neutron state. That these are degrees of freedom and not just labels of a particle is made clear by beta decay, in which a neutron can decay into a proton (by emitting a positron and an electron neutrino). This is a classic example of an *internal symmetry*, a symmetry that is not related to some transformation of spacetime.

### Transformation groups

Clearly a a sequence of transformations is itself a transformation. When implemented via linear operators, this arises because for $U_1, U_2$ unitary operators, $U_1 U_2$ is also unitary as you can easily check. In fact, transformations form a *group*. It is worth stepping back and describing this mathematical object. Groups are a classic case of simple systems yielding rich structures; group theory yields powerful results and insights into quantum mechanics.

A *group* $G$ is a collection of objects $g, h, ...$ which could be countable (disceret) or uncountable, endoweed with a multiplication law such that $g\cdot h \in G$ \forall gm h \in G$. This multiplication law satisfies the following properties:

1. *Existence of an identity*. There is an element $e \in G$ such that $e g = g e = g \forall g \in G$.

2. *Existence of an inverse*. For every $g \in G$, there exists a group element $g^{-1} \in G$ such that $g g^{-1} = g^{-1} g = e$. 

3. *Associativity*. For any $f, g, g \in G$, 
```{math}
f \cdot (g \cdot h) = (f \cdot g) \cdot h
```
where one does the multiplication in parentheses first. 

Note that in general it is not true that $g\cdot h h \cdot g$. Groups that satisfy this proiperty are called *Abelian*; otherwise they are called *non-Abelian*.

There are many examples of groups. A few are

1. Discrete translations in space ${\vec x} \to {\vec x} + \sum_i n_i {\vec a}^i$, for ${\vec a}$ a collection of linearly independent vectors and $n_i \in \CZ$. This is clearly an Abelian group; "multiplication" in this case is simply vector addition.

2. Permutations. These are one-to-one and onto transformations of $n$ elements into themselves:
```{math}
\sigma : (1,2,\ldots n) = (\sigma(1), \sigma(2), \ldots, \sigma(n))
```
This group is often called $S_n$, and it is non-Abelian if $n > 2$; I recommend convincing yourself of this by playing with $S_3$. 

3. $n \times n$ invertible matrices ($GL(n, \CR)$ for real matrices or $GL(n,\CC)$ for complex matrices). These form a non-Abelian group under matrix multiplication.
