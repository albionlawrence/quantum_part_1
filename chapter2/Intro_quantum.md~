# Introduction to quantum mechanics

I will start with a quasi-historical, phenomenological discussion of some basic aspects of quantum mechanics:

1. The need for a new dimensionful quantity $\hbar with units [Energy $\times$ time].
2. The quantization of the energy of light with frequency $\omega$ into parcels ("photons") with energy $\hbar \omega$,
3. The fact that quantum states can be written as complex vectors, and that the sum of two such vectors is another legitimate quantum state.
4. The probabilistic nature of the outcome of quantum measurements.

These are all important; point (3) motivates a serious survey/review of linear algebra, which is also needed to discuss (4) more precisely.
