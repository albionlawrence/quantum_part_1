# Bound state spectra for the Coulomb problem

We now focus on solving the Coulomb problem:
```{math}
- \frac{\hbar^2}{2\mu} \psi({\vec x}) - \frac{e^2}{|{\vec x|} \psi = (E - E_{com}) \psi
```
We will redefine $E - E_{com} \to E$ just to make reading (and writing) easier. 

Note that the reduced mass $\mu$ is
```{math}
\mu = \frac{m_e m_p}{m_e + m_p} = \frac{m_e}{1 + \frac{m_e}{m_p}} \sim m_e \left(1 - \frac{m_e}{m_p} + \cO(\frac{m_e^2}{m_p^2})\right)
```
since $\frac{m_e}{m_p} \sim 5\times 10^{-4}$, the reduced mass in this case is very close to the electron mass.

## Reduction to the radial equation

This Hamiltonian is invariant under rotations. It therefore makes sense to write the Schroedinger equation in spherical coordinates. This transformation is standard and it is worth it for you to work it out yourself. The end result is:
```{math}
- \frac{\hbar^2}2\mu} \frac{1}{r} \frac{\del^2}{\del r^2} (r\psi) - \frac{\hbar^2}{2\mu r^2} {\vec L}^2\psi - \frac{e^2}{r} \psi = E\psi
```
Now all of the angular derivatives are contained in ${\vec L}^2$. Thus, we can us separation of variables, and write $\psi = f(r) \chi(\theta,\phi)$. Inserting this equation, and dividing by $\psi$, we find
```{math}
:label: separated_hydrogen
- \frac{\hbar^2}2\mu f} \frac{1}{r} \frac{\del^2}{\del r^2} (rf) - \frac{1}{2\mu r^2 \chi} {\vec L}^2\chi - \frac{e^2}{r} = E
```
Further multiplying by $2\mu r^2$, there is only one term involving $\chi$ or any other function of the angular coordinates, which is the term proportional to ${\vec L}^2\chi$. Thus we can deduce that
```{math}
\frac{1}{\chi}{\vec L}^2 \chi = C
```
for some constant $C$. Multiplying this by $\chi$, we have an eigenvalue equation for the operator ${\vec L}^2$. But we know the solution -- $\chi$ mist be a spherical harmonic $Y_{\ell,m}(\theta,\phi)$, and $C = \hbar^2\ell(\ell + 1)$. Insering this into {eq}`separated_hydrogen`, we find:
```{math}
- \frac{\hbar^2}{2\mu} \frac{1}{r} \frac{\del^2}{\del r^2}(r f(r)) = \frac{\hbar^2 \ell(\ell + 1)}{2\mu r^2} f - \frac{e^2}{r} f = E f
```
Finally, if we multiply teh entire equation by $r$ and define $u = r f(r)$, we have and "effective" Schroedinger equation:
```{math}
- \frac{\hbar^2}{2\mu} \del_r^2 u(r) + \left[\frac{\hbar^2 \ell(\ell + 1)}{2\mu r^2} - \frac{e^2}{r}\right] u = E u
```
This is a one-dimensional Schroedinger equation with an "effective potential"
```{math}
V_{eff} = \frac{\hbar^2 \ell(\ell + 1)}{2\mu r^2} - \frac{e^2}{r}
```
This is sketched below. There is a COulomb potential and for $\ell \neq 0$, a "centrifugal barrier" keeping the electron from the proton. This barrier is absent for $\ell = 0$, and one might worry that the problem is ill-defined because the potential is singular. Classically, this is only a problem if we have truly point particles and fire them right at each other. Quantum-mechanically, we will see that the problem is well-defined for the correct choice of boundary conditions. In the end, $r$ is an operator, and $\vev{\frac{e^2}{r}}$ in any well-defined quantum state is finite.

It should be clear from this figure that we expect bound states for $E < 0$, since the wavefunction will be in the classically forbidden region for $r \to \infty$ and will die off exponentially. for $E > 0$ we expect a continuum of propagating states, desribing scattering of the electron and proton. 

## Boundary conditions for $u(r)$

Before continuing, we need to examine the boundary conditions for $u(r)$ at $r = 0$, $r = \infty$. In the latter case, since $V_{eff} \to 0$, the approximate solution is
```{math}
u(r) \sim e^{\pm \gamma r}\ ; \ \ \gamma = \sqrt{\frac{2\mu E}{\hbar^2}}
```
Clearly we need to choose the eponentially decaying solution (or the wavefunction is not normalizable).

For $r \to 0$, the story is a little more subtle. Let us first consider $\ell > 0$. As $r \to 0$, the centrifugal barrier term in the Schroedinger equation dominates $E u$ or $e^2 u/r$, because $1/r^2$ blows up more quackly that $1/r$. Thus, as $r \to 0$, the Schrodinger equation becomes
```{math}
- \frac{\hbar^2}{2\mu} \del_r^2 u + \frac{\hbar^2 \ell}{2\mu r^2} u = 0
```
multiplying through by $2\mu/\hbar^2$ we can see that both terms scale the same as $r \to \lambda r$; that is, they both scale as $\lambda^{-2}$. In this case, a solution of the form $u \propto r^{\alpha}$ makes sense. since both terms will reduce the power of $\alpha$ and can be balanced against each other. The result is
```{math}
- \alpha(\alpha - 1) + \ell(\ell + 1) = 0
```
which has solutions $\alpha = - \ell, \ell +1$. The former leads to a wavfunction of the form
```{math}
\psi = frac{u}{r} Y_{\ell,m} \sim r^{-\ell - 1}
```
When we compute the norm, 
```{math}
\int dr r^2 d\phi \sin\theta d\theta |\psi|^2 \sim \int dr \frac{1}{r^{2\ell + 1}} + \ldots 
```
which clearly diverges; so we demand that $u\to r^{\ell + 1}$ as $r \to 0$.

When $\ell = 0$, the Coulomb term dominates, but scales differently in $r$. We assume that $u$ can be expanded in a power series, $u \sim r^{\alpha} (1 + a_1 t + a_2 r^2 + \ldots)$. Inserting this into the equation
```{math}
- \frac{\hbar^2}{2\mu} \del_r^2 u + \frac{e}{r} u = E u
```
the most singular term comes from the second derivative acting on $r^{\alpha}$, and is proportional to $\alpha(\alpha - 1)r^{\alpha - 2}$. This has the solutions $u \propto 1$ and $u \propto r$. In fact both are annihilated by the second derivative, but when we expand the solution to the full equation in a power series, we will see that it comes out OK.

Now $u \sim 1 \Rightarrow \psi \sim \frac{1}{r}$. While this is putatively ormalizable at the origin, it is in fact problematic; the wvafunction has a sharp kin at the origin. One can in fact show that ${\vec \nabla}^2 \frac{1}{r} \propto \delta(r)$. This delta function singularity cannot balance against the other terms in the Schroedinger equation. Thus, we demand that $u \sim r$.
