# The Aharonov-Bohm effect

The first system we will explore is a particle moving in a region containing a magnetic field. This allows us to explore the structure of quantum mechanics in a background electromagnetic field, and leads to a surprising consequence -- even when the field vanishes where the particle can move, it has a measurable effect on the particle's wavefunction.

## Charged particle in an electromagnetic field

So far we have considered the case of a constant magnetic field. Here we will consider the more general case of an electromagnetic field. 

Two of Maxwell's equations,
```{math}
:label: bianchi_ident
\begin{align}
\frac{\del {\vec E}}{\del t} & = c {\vec\nabla}\times{\vec B}\\ 
{\vec\nabla}\cdot{\vec B} & = 0
\end{align}
```
imply that in a simply connected region, ${\vec E}$, {\vec B}$ can be written in the form
```{math}
:label: gauge_potentials
\begin{align}
{\vec E} & = - \frac{1}{c} \frac{\del {\vec A}}{\del t} - {\vec \nabla} \Phi\\
{\vec B} & = {\vec\nabla}\times{\vec A}
\end{align}
```
The fact that a single solution ${\vec A}, \Phi$ can generally only be found in a simply connected region will become important to us below.

The Lagrangian for a charged particle in this background is
```{math}
:label: em_lag
L - \half m {\dot{\vec x}}^2 + \frac{e}{c} {\dot{\vec x}}\cdot{\vec A} - q \Phi
```
where $q$ is the charge of the particle. Applyin the Euler-Lagrange equation to this, combined with {eq}`gauge_poentials`, leads to the Lorentz force law
```{math}
:label: 
m {\ddot{\vec x}} = \deac{q}{c}{\vec{\dot x}}\times{\vec B} + q {\vec E}
```
As it happens we cannot simply write $L$ in terms of the physical field variables ${\vec E}, {\vec B}$. To get a sensible variational principle the Lagrangian needs to be written a s afunction of the vector and scalar potentials $\Phi, {\vec A}$. 

It is important to note that $\Phi, {\vec A}$ are ambiguously defined via {eq}`gauge_potentials`. If we shift ${\vec A} \to {\vec A} - {\vac\nabla}$, $\Phi \to \Phi + \frac{1}{c} \frac{\del \Lambda}{\del t}$, then the electric and magnetic fields do not change. This shoft in fact makes no real physical change: it is called a *gauge transformation* or *gauge symmetry*.
