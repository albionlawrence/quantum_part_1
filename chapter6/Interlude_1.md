# Interlude: two interesting systems

The goal of this next section (following chapter 6 of the book) is to explore a couple of actually observable and important effects that get at the basic structure of quantum mechanics. The first, the Aharaonov-Bohm effect, follows naturally fro mthe previous section. The second, neutrino oscillations, could perhaps have been discussed earlier, but there is no time like the present.
